## What is Tap-e-oke?


I don't know.


It's software designed to be controlled by a shoe with a bluetooth transmitter.


I guess I do know.

## How do I control the Stomp n' go?
The Stomp N' Go has multiple control styles. The controllers for other games are available in the controller folder. This whole software requires node software to run. Hopefully you can figure it out.

Hopefully.
