## How do I control the Stomp n' go?
The Stomp N' Go has multiple control styles. The controllers for other games are available in the controller folder. This whole software requires node software to run. Hopefully you can figure it out.

Hopefully.

If you're not a developer, or not experienced with node JS, install it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

If you don't know how to run a Node.js file, go [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6737824/how-to-run-a-hello-js-file-in-node-js-on-windows).

If you're worried that this isn't secure, well, it's open source, so you can read the code yourself.
